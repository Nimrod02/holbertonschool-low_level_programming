## Introduction

This repository showcases my journey through low-level programming, with an emphasis on C. Each directory represents a distinct project undertaken during my time at Holberton School, ranging from introductory projects on C basics to advanced topics covering memory management, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Projects

Below is a brief overview of some of the key projects included in this repository:

- **hello_world**: An introduction to C programming, focusing on compilation and syntax basics.
- **variables_if_else_while**: Exploring variables, control structures, and loops in C.
- **functions_nested_loops**: Deep dive into functions and nested loops, understanding scope and declarations.
- **debugging**: Techniques and practices for debugging C programs.
- **more_functions_nested_loops**: Further exploration of functions and nested loops, with more complex algorithms.
- **pointers_arrays_strings**: Introduction to pointers, arrays, and string manipulation in C.
- **...and many more**: For a complete list of projects, please refer to the project directory within this repository.

## Installation

To clone this repository and explore these projects, run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Nimrod02/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```

## Usage

Each project directory contains files relevant to a specific assignment or task. To compile the C files, you might generally use:

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o <output-file-name>
```

Please refer to the README.md file within each project directory for specific instructions on compiling and running each program.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the projects or documentation are welcome. Please, first discuss the change you wish to make via issues before making a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

- Hat tip to all the peers and mentors at Holberton School who have provided feedback and support.
- Special thanks to the creators of the C programming language, without whom these learning experiences would not be possible.
